    "# Python Essentials for Water\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become part of the toolbox of scientists and engineers, and has numerous applications in hydrology. By mastering Python, you are able to extend data analysis and modelling capabilities far beyond what is possible with spreadsheets, GIS platforms and other standard software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an open source, object-oriented programming language used for both standalone programs and scripting applications. It was initially developed by Guido van Rossum, who named it after Monty Python's Flying Circus. Python is popular because it is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, but also because it has many extensions that make it suitable for an enormous range of applications. Other advantages are that it is open-source and runs on all major operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is not necessary to compile it into binary machine code before a program can be ran. Instead, the commands are executed in an interpreter, which may be embedded in a web browser, as is the case when using Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things that are worth mentioning upfront and these must be remembered at all times. First of all, Python is case sensitive, so a variable with the name `avariable` is not the same as `Avariable` or `AVARIABLE`. Second, systematic indentation is a feature of the Python language (this will be explained below). Third, Python starts counting at zero, not at one. This sometimes confuses people but it is not that different from the way we count time: The first hour of a day is also numbered zero!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python consists of the core language and comes with a comprehensive standard library. In addition, there are many third-party packages (or libraries). Scientists and engineers typically choose the Anaconda Python distribution because it includes many of the most useful package already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that the packages are easy to update, and that Anaconda will usually install without major hassles. To install Anaconda go to the website https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and download the installer for your operating system. Once downloaded, double-click on the installer and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks (or simply 'notebooks') provide a way to execute Python code in a web browser. As you can see below,  notebooks contain cells, which either have text (called Markdown) or code. The code cells can easily be recognized as they are preceded by `In [ ]:` or `In [n]:` where `n` is a counter. To execute a code cell, position your cursor in it, hold the [shift] key and hit [enter]. The output, preceded by `Out [n]:` (where `n` is a number), then appears below the code cell."

First a list with values is defined, some of which are negative. Suppose we're interested in picking only the negative values from the list. It is possible to write a for loop with a conditional statement using a few lines of code to do this (try it if you like). The alternative method of list comprehension, however, allows you to combine this into a single line. As you can see the `for` and `if` statements are enclosed with in the square brackets. The `for` loop steps over each of the elements in `values` and with each step value of `v` changes. The `ìf` statement ensures that `v` is only added to the new list (called `negative_values`) when `v` is less than zero."
